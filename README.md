This is a connect 4 project that I made for my APCS project in 2021. There are two playing modes: against the computer and a 2-player game. 
Most of the challenge in this was writing ComputerMove, which simulates a move that the computer does. I designed it so that the computer
would play whichever move would connect more pieces together, whether in a diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line.
