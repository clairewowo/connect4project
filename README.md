This is a connect 4 project that I made for my AP Computer Science project in 2021. There are two playing modes: against the computer or a 2-player game. 
Most of the challenge in this was writing ComputerMove, which simulates a move that the computer does. I designed it so that the computer
would play a move that, once played, maximized the number of tokens connected, or maximized the other player's number of tokens blocked.
